# Plant Disease Detection Model

This project is a machine learning model designed to detect diseases in plants. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images and can accurately identify various plant diseases. The model is stored in an H5 file and can be easily loaded and used for predictions.

## Project Overview

The Plant Disease Detection Model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained on a dataset of plant images. The model can classify images of plants into different disease categories, providing valuable information for plant health management.
